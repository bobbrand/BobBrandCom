                <p class="lead my-4">
                    <p class="lead">A colleague once said that you can have an opinion, but you cannot argue with data. This is really an
                        important point. Data plays a critical role in areas like product management, software development,
                        and software quality. I am talking directly about quantitative tracking and analytics and not so
                        much about qualitative data from surveys, although both may have a role.</p>
                    <p>
                        The advent of behavioral and diagnostic analytics transformed how products evolve and how software services work, but the
                        more general impact of data on software development drives value from many directions. Let's breakdown
                        just a few.</p>
                    <h3>Behavioral Analytics</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>How often and how a feature is used</li>
                        <li>Measure conversions (digital marketing)</li>
                        <li>Debugging UX</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Diagnostic Analytics</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Specific crash rates around frequency, impact to users</li>
                        <li>Measure conversions (digital marketing)</li>
                        <li>Debugging UX</li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Quality Analytics</h3>
