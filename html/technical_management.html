                    engineers to as large as 70 engineers spanning multiple countries and timezones, covering many different
                    technologies and products. This experience has shaped my own identity as a technical manager.

                    Like many managers, I am the product of my mentors who shared their wisdom and experience and who I admired and respected
                    over the course of my career. I have learned much from leaders I have worked for and worked with over
                    the years. These are some examples that describe elements of my leadership style.

                        Leaders have to get commun&shy;ication right. As a leader, I speak and write clearly and effectively. I document workflows,
                        tools, and designs so that they can be reviewed and shared with others. I prefer collaborative tools
                        like Confluence, Slack, and Teams. I have used videos to demonstrate and share complex ideas. I do
                        not host a lot of meetings, and when I do, I try to ensure the content is important to everyone in
                        the meeting. I prefer meetings as a tool for design, collaboration, strategy, and broadcasting information
                        as opposed to meetings for collecting status. I pass down direction through leaders in the organization,
                        and I prefer to get feedback directly. I believe strongly in weekly 1:1 meetings as a space to communicate
                        directly about topics ranging from project status, priorities, strategy, career, and performance.
                        I am an effective public speaker and have presented at technical conferences and also served on a
                        team as a coach to other presenters.

                        Good leaders prioritize force multipliers as a means to drive team efficiency. This is a primary impetus for effective software
                        managers to be engaged in tools, automation, continuos integration, and continuous deployment. Force
                        multipliers can take many forms. Better equipment is an example. Automation is another. If you can
                        find a way to save 10 minutes in a workflow that an engineer uses 10 times a day, then you are effectively
                        adding recurring resources to your team without incurring additional cost beyond the NRE to improve
                        the workflow. Sometimes writing something down saves the time of somebody else having to repeat the
                        steps to accomplish something. Even team building has a role. For example, having one local QA engineer
                        to supplement an offshore QA team can reduce painful turn-around times when investigating issues.
                        Using a nearshore team in place of an offshore team can have a similar benefit. When managing an
                        organization, I look continuously for opportunities to save time and maximize resources.

                        Coll&shy;aboration is a style and a way of working. It can sit on a spectrum with competitiveness. If there are two similar
                        ideas, a collaboration will seek to combine the ideas to produce a better result, whereas a competition
                        will partition ownership and seek to place one idea firmly above the other. There is a role for both
                        in business. Collaboration should not be confused with compromise. Compromise is a tool that is available
                        when collaborating, but it is often not needed to create an optimal solution. My style is openly
                        collaborative. I tend to explain problems and solicit solutions rather than dictate edicts. Techniques
                        including peer reviews, information sharing, retros, and being open to continuous improvement exemplify
                        a collaborative environment. A collaborative team recognizes contributions, shares in successes,
                        and learns and moves on from mistakes rather than focusing on blame and reward. This makes working
                        environments both more productive and enjoyable.

                        Servant leadership places the role of a leader in support of the team. In engineering, this is a particularly important attribute,
                        because teams are often structured such that the most knowledgeable and productive members of a team
                        are not the manager, but are the dedicated individual contributors and subject matter experts who
                        are doing the hands-on work every day. This means that the most effective thing a manager can do
                        is to allow the team to do their jobs with the most efficient workflows, best tools, and the least
                        amount of interruptions. A good manager will act as a shield to the team, absorbing distractions
                        that suck energy and time from the team. Effective servant leadership requires trust and mutual respect,
                        because a manager has to allow team members to do their jobs effectively.

                        In my management approach, Agile means aspiring to achieve the
                        <a class="text-light" href="https://www.agilealliance.org/agile101/12-principles-behind-the-agile-manifesto">12 Principles Behind the Agile Manifesto</a>                        as described by the Agile Alliance. This does not mean we have to rigidly execute Scrum workflows.
                        Scrum is only a tool. There is no mention of sprints, stories, velocity, nor ceremonies in the manifesto
                        or its principles. Instead, Agile is about empowering teams. Agile means that we should work incrementally,
                        that we should react to events in our business and environment, that we should continuously reevaluate
                        our progress and reprioritize our goals in the context of the changes in the business environment,
                        and that actions speak louder than words. To effectively do these things, we must communicate well.
                        Our engineering teams must be engaged with the business teams, not just at the senior level, but
                        at the team level. And everyone must share information so that we can make sound business-oriented
                        decisions together. Some people think that agile philosophies are at odds with timely execution,
                        but that is not the case. If your business priority is to execute to a schedule, then Agile just
                        gives you a framework to work in to make that happen. "How does one eat an elephant?" the adage goes,
                        "One bite at a time," replies the Agile sage.

                        A leader's decisions are only as good as the data that they are based on, and there is no more important quality than transparency
                        and honesty. Managers are particularly susceptible to providing feedback that might hide underlying
                        problems in the team or its execution in order to delay or avoid judgement. But this kind of unreliability
                        puts an upstream manager in the impossible position of not being able to react nor provide support
                        until it is too late. In my blog, I talk about the importance of being data driven and of measuring
                        results. Open collaborative environments require transparency to be effective. My propensity for
                        writing things down, using quantitative data, and sharing information speaks to the value I place
                        on it. I have a history of eschewing the gatekeeper mentality, meaning those people who regard closely
                        held knowledge as job security. If there is some method of doing something, a tool, or process that
                        nobody else knows, then simply write it down, show others how to do it, automate it, and move on
                        to a more creatively challenging problem. I let job security be the continuous value that one brings
                        to an organization rather than a finite piece of past knowledge. I value openness, honesty, and transparency
                        as core values of effective leadership.

                        Anecdotally, the people management experiences alone have helped me grow as a part-time therapist,
                        mentor, life-coach, as well as an adversary or enemy to some. But the whole of my experience brings
                        a perspective that helps me to adapt to new environments, understand the strengths and weaknesses
                        of organizations, adjust my style and approach to meet the needs of an organization, build healthy
                        cultures, and to provide valuable insight for growing companies that are transitioning from one type
                        of environment to another.

                                <p>Turtle Beach is a consumer electronics company focused on gaming accessories. They are a
                                    market leader in console gaming headsets and earned $366M in revenue in 2021. The engineering
                                    teams are small and the product cycles are short and aggressive. There are software teams
                                    that develop embedded firmware for headsets as well as for mobile, PC, and Mac support
                                    apps. </p>
                                <p>I joined Turtle Beach in 2020 as Senior Director of Software. I undertook several initiatives
                                    to help level-up the software teams and modernize workflows. These included engaging
                                    with a near-shore team in Guadalajara to augment the mobile apps software development
                                    in the U.S., introducing Agile workflows to software engineering, and working with product
                                    management to create some of the first product backlogs for prioritizing features.</p>
                                <p>I introduced behavioral and diagnostic analytics in our mobile applications and demonstrated
                                    basic analytics analysis, developing and documenting queries in Kusto using Azure's Application
                                    Insights. I drove improvements in the mobile app that helped boost the ratings of the
                                    iOS and Android apps from a low 2-star rating to 4.8 and 4.4 stars respectively.</p>
                                <p>I promoted the concepts of test automation and build and deployment automation in the engineering
                                    teams where neither had been in use prior. I prototyped the first python-controlled relays
                                    in the context of a test automation system to control the firmware running on the products,
                                    and developed a YAML-based continuous deployment pipeline using GitHub Actions prior
                                    to hiring and onboarding a lead for devops and a software test manager.</p>
                                <p>I introduced Atlassian Confluence for documentation while contributing hundreds of pages
                                    of documentation for designs, processes, diagnostics, interfaces, pipelines, tools, recruiting,
                                    and onboarding.</p>
                                <p>In addition to the management responsibilities and the work described above, I developed
                                    a significant amount of firmware and tools as an individual contributor, some of which
                                    is described in the <a href=".software_development.html" class="text-light">Software Development</a>                                    section.</p>

                                <p>I joined GoPro as a Sr. Engineering Manager in 2017 shortly after GoPro's IPO. My charter
                                    was the development of the iOS and Android Capture mobile apps in addition to Android,
                                    iOS, embedded wireless SDKs. This charter also included a small embedded Linux team focused
                                    on the camera-side connectivity interface. My organization totaled 30 developers, all
                                    located in San Diego.</p>
                                <p>GoPro Plus, a cloud-based subscription service for GoPro users, was an an important strategic
                                    project at GoPro during this time. For the mobile apps, this included support for GoPro's
                                    new cloud-based media storage, internationalized mobile UI, REST interfaces, authentication,
                                    push notifications, in-app payments, behavioral and diagnostic analytics, media management,
                                    as well as WiFi and BLE connectivity to GoPro cameras. The mobile apps are a key strategic
                                    part of GoPro's mobile-first cloud offering.</p>
                                <p>During my time at GoPro, I scaled the mobile development by decoupling mobile front-end teams
                                    from mobile wireless SDKs. The bifurcation enabled the connectivity SDKs to serve multiple
                                    apps, for example to support GoPro's drone development and third-party developer programs
                                    at the time.</p>
                                <p>The GoPro apps served millions of monthly active users, and my teams worked collaboratively
                                    with product owners, UX designers, visual designers, program managers, system architects,
                                    and QA engineering using agile workflows to deliver world-class mobile applications.</p>
                                <p>Taking cues from my leadership, I strived for a culture of hard work and life-balance with
                                    a heavy emphasis on technology, innovation, and continuous learning helping make GoPro
                                    a satisfying place to work.

                                <p>As Director of Engineering at Broadcom, I was responsible for the organization that developed
                                    the mobile, PC, and embedded software, protocol stacks, tools, and development kits for
                                    Broadcom's Bluetooth, NFC, and 802.15.4 portfolio of standalone and combo connectivity
                                    silicon. There were as many as seventy engineers in my organization, located on the U.S.
                                    West Coast, East Coast, Europe, India, and Taiwan.</p>
                                <p>I joined Broadcom in 2008, a year after the introduction of the iPhone, and just prior to
                                    the introduction of the first Android phones. This was an important time as a transition
                                    to the new mobile computing paradigm was creating an insatiable demand for Wifi + Bluetooth
                                    combo silicon in which Broadcom had a dominant position.</p>
                                <p>I assembled a team to work on Android AOSP software, leveraging a core group of software
                                    engineers who were experts in connectivity but were not familiar with Java, Git, Gerrit,
                                    nor the new scales of software development that came with AOSP development. I contracted
                                    consultants to train the existing engineers in the new technologies while hiring to augment
                                    the team with experts in these new areas. I worked to develop the infrastructure to build
                                    and optimize the large-scale code base that allowed to the teams to work effectively,
                                    often collaborating with other engineering directors in Broadcom to share and learn organizational
                                    best practices.</p>
                                <p>My team gained software traction by helping the largest Android OEMs at the time, including
                                    Samsung, LGE, HTC, Sony, and others to provide higher performance connectivity than the
                                    base AOSP was delivering at the time. This complemented Broadcom's combo connectivity
                                    business strategy that was growing into a multi-billion dollar business.</p>
                                <p>Within Broadcom, I advocated for an open source strategy for our core protocol stacks. I
                                    worked collaboratively with our business development and product marketing teams to develop
                                    and document an open source strategy that would benefit Broadcom. I presented the strategy
                                    at an annual Broadcom Techincal Conference attended by hundreds of Broadcom's most senior
                                    technical staff, CEO and CTO.</p>
                                <p>The success that we had with top Android OEMs caught Google's attention, and this led to
                                    discussions about contributing Broadcom's core Bluetooth and NFC protocol stack software
                                    to the AOSP. This led to a multi-year collaboration with Google to integrate and deploy
                                    open source versions of the Bluetooth and NFC protocol stacks. During this time I was
                                    engaged with Google technical leaders, our OEM customers around the world, Broadcom's
                                    business development and legal teams, and my own engineers to make the contribution a
                                    success for Android users and all parties.

                                <p>As Director of Engineering at Cypress Semiconductor, my charter included Bluetooth software
                                    and firmware for IoT, embedded, audio, and HID applications. My team was approximately
                                    50 engineers and managers located on the U.S. West Coast, East Coast, India, and Taiwan.</p>
                                <p>Cypress had recently acquired Broadcom Wifi and Bluetooth IP as well as the engineering team
                                    for IoT development. IoT was broadly interpreted to included most applications with the
                                    exception of mobile phones and tablets, but because many of the developers, management,
                                    and IP had come from Broadcom, much of the work was familiar.</p>
                                <p>While at Cypress, my teams helped develop and launch several high volume consumer HID and
                                    wearable products for OEM customers, launched smart cameras and other IoT devices in
                                    collaboration with our Wifi colleagues, developed Cypress's first TWS earbuds, and supported
                                    existing businesses in set-top box and automotive connectivity.</p>
                                <p>Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) is a key technology for IoT, and new development focused on BLE-optimized
                                    silicon as well as BLE mesh for smart home and commercial automation applications.</p>
                                <p>While at Cypress, our Bluetooth team worked together with other Cypress engineering teams
                                    in the U.S., Ukraine, and India to integrate Bluetooth connectivity technology into Cypress's
                                    Modus Toolkit ecosystem.

                                <p>WIDCOMM was a technology startup founded in 1998 to create Bluetooth solutions for PCs, mobile
                                    phones, automobiles, and consumer devices. The WIDCOMM Bluetooth protocol stack was the
                                    Bluetooth SIG's first qualified product.</p>
                                <p>As Director of Software Engineering, I built and managed a team of engineers focused on WIDCOMM's
                                    Bluetooth protocol stack implementation, its profiles, and its application in embedded
                                    connectivity. We developed SDKs, hardware reference designs, and software tools in addition
                                    to the software itself.</p>
                                <p>I worked collaboratively with our team to develop and document software workflows, tools,
                                    and processes that were appropriate for a startup technology company.</p>
                                <p>Bluetooth was an emerging technology in the early 2000s, and it was starting to get traction
                                    in mobile phones. Working closely with our product managers, we designed an API and SDK
                                    tailored for mobile phone integration, which helped provide an advantage against generic
                                    solutions when competing for mobile sockets.</p>
                                <p>I was a technology advocate for Bluetooth while at WIDCOMM, and I presented on topics related
                                    to Bluetooth technology at the 3G Mobile Systems Conference in Tokyo, as well as presenting
                                    for San Diego's local technical community.</p>
                                <p>WIDCOMM was acquired by Broadcom in 2004.</p>

                                <p>Staccato Communications was a technology startup founded in 2002 to develop the world's first
                                    single-chip CMOS ultra-wideband SoC. Its products included single-chip integrated circuits,
                                    device adapters, reference design kits, and software development kits. </p>
                                <p>As the Director of Software Engineering, I built and managed the software team responsible
                                    for embedded MAC firmware, framework, tools, drivers, embedded and Windows SDKs as well
                                    as applications of UWB ultra-wideband technology including Wireless USB and Bluetooth
                                    AMP. I also initiated offshore development to mitigate costs of non-core development.</p>
                                <p>At Staccato, the firmware was developed from the ground up in embedded C using a form of
                                    template method pattern and related strategies to incorporate diagnostics into the core
                                    design. The philosophy of design for test allowed the technical IP to be built on top
                                    of a lightweight diagnostics framework as opposed to "bolting on" diagnostics after the
                                    implementation was complete.</p>
                                <p>I worked with our software developers to codify software process and workflows that were
                                    appropriate for a technology startup, creating a disciplined development environment
                                    that did not stifle the team's creativity or ability to work quickly.</p>
                                <p>UWB was an emerging technology and I worked closely with our marketing, sales, and international
                                    customers providing sales material and training collateral. My team and I provided on-site
                                    technical support to promote Staccato's ultra-wideband technology to key customers.</p>
