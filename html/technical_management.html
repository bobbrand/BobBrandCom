                    shaped my own identity as a technical manager.

                    Like many managers, I am the product of my mentors who shared their wisdom and experience and who I admired and respected
                    over the course of my career. I have learned much from leaders I have worked for and worked with over
                    the years. These are some examples that describe elements of my leadership style.

                        Leaders have to get commun&shy;ication right. As a leader, I document workflows, tools, and designs so that they can be reviewed
                        and shared with others. I prefer collaborative tools like Confluence, Slack, and Teams. I have used
                        videos to demonstrate and share complex ideas. I do not call a lot of meetings, and when I do, I
                        try to ensure the content is important to everyone in the meeting. I prefer meetings as a tool for
                        design, collaboration, strategy, and broadcasting information as opposed to meetings for collecting
                        status. I pass down direction through leaders in the organization, and I prefer to query status directly.
                        I believe strongly in weekly 1:1 meetings as a space to communicate directly about topics ranging
                        from project status, priorities, strategy, career, or performance. I am an effective public speaker
                        and have presented at a couple of technical conferences and also served on a team as a coach to other
                        presenters.

                    <div class="single-post-content-wrapper">
                        Good leaders prioritize force multipliers as a means to drive team efficiency. This is a primary impetus for effective software
                        managers to be engaged in tools, automation, and Devops. Force multipliers can take many forms. Better
                        equipment is an example. Automation is another. If you can find a way to save 10 minutes in a workflow
                        that an engineer uses 10 times a day, then you are effectively adding recurring resources to your
                        team without incurring additional cost beyond the NRE to improve the workflow. Sometimes writing
                        something down saves the time of somebody else having to repeat the steps to accomplish something.
                        Even team building has a role. For example, having one local QA engineer to supplement an offshore
                        QA team can reduce painful turn-around times. Using a nearshore team in place of an offshore team
                        can have a similar benefit. When managing an organization, I look continuously for opportunities
                        to save time and maximize resources.

                        Coll&shy;aboration is a style and a way of working. It can sit on a spectrum with competitiveness. If there are two similar
                        ideas, a collaboration will seek to combine the ideas to produce a better result, whereas a competition
                        will partition ownership and seek to place one idea firmly above the other. There is a role for both
                        in business. My style is openly more collaborative. I tend to explain problems and solicit solutions
                        rather than dictate edicts. Techniques including peer reviews, information sharing, retros, and being
                        open to continuous improvement exemplify a collaborative environment. A collaborative team shares
                        in successes, and learns and moves on from mistakes rather than focusing on blame. This makes working
                        environments both more productive and enjoyable.

                        Servant leadership places the role of a leader in support of the team. In engineering, this is a particularly important attribute,
                        because teams are often structured such that the most knowledgeable and productive members of a team
                        are not the manager, but are the dedicated individual contributors and subject matter experts who
                        are doing the hands-on work every day. This means that the most effective thing a manager can do
                        is to allow the team to do their jobs with the most efficient workflows, best tools, and the least
                        amount of interruptions. A good manager will act as a shield to the team, absorbing distractions
                        that suck energy and time from the team. Effective servant leadership requires trust and mutual respect,
                        because a manager has to allow team members to do their jobs effectively.

                        </span> as described by the Agile Alliance. This does not mean we have to
                        rigidly execute Scrum workflows. It does not mean that at all. There are no mentions of sprints,
                        stories, velocity, or ceremonies in the manifesto or its principles. Instead, Agile is about empowering
                        teams. Agile means that we should work incrementally, that we should react to changes in our business
                        and environment, that we should continuously reevaluate our progress and reprioritize our goals in
                        the context of the business environment, and that actions speak louder than words. To effectively
                        do these things, we must communicate well. Our engineering teams must be engaged with the business
                        teams, not just at the senior level, but at the team level. And everyone must share information so
                        that we can make sound business-oriented decisions together. Some people think that agile philosophies
                        are at odds with accurate execution, but that is not the case. If your business priority is to execute
                        to a schedule, then Agile just gives you a framework to work in to make that happen. "How does one
                        eat an elephant?" the adage goes, "One bite at a time."

                        A leader's decisions are only as good as the data that they are based on, and there is no more important quality than transparency
                        and honesty. Managers are particularly susceptible to providing feedback that might hide underlying
                        problems in the team or its execution in order to delay or avoid judgement. But this kind of unreliability
                        puts an upstream manager in the impossible position of not being able to react or provide support
                        until it is too late. In my blog, I talk about the importance of being data driven and of measuring
                        results. Open collaborative environments require transparency to be effective. My propensity for
                        writing things down, using quantitative data, and sharing information speaks to the value I place
                        on it. I have a history of eschewing the gatekeeper mentality, meaning those people who regard closely
                        held knowledge as job security. If there is some method of doing something, a tool, or process that
                        nobody else knows, then simply write it down, show others how to do it, automate it, and move on
                        to a more creatively challenging problem. I let job security be the continuous value that one brings
                        to an organization rather than a finite piece of past knowledge. I value openness, honesty, and transparency
                        as core values of effective leadership.

                        smaller companies that are transitioning into larger organizations. I have managed in different corporate
                        cultures, in different economic and business environments, and under different leadership styles.
                        Anecdotally, the people management experiences alone have helped me grow as a part-time therapist,
                        mentor, life-coach, as well as an adversary or enemy to some. But the whole of my experience brings
                        a perspective that helps me to adapt to new environments, understand the strengths and weaknesses
                        of organizations, adjust my style and approach to meet the needs of an organization, build healthy
                        cultures, and to provide valuable insight for growing companies that are transitioning from one type

                                <p>WIDCOMM was a technology startup founded in 1998 to create Bluetooth solutions for PCs, mobile
                                    phones, automobiles, and consumer devices. The WIDCOMM Bluetooth protocol stack was the
                                    Bluetooth SIG's first qualified product.</p>
                                <p>As Director of Software Engineering, I built and managed a team of engineers focused on WIDCOMM's
                                    Bluetooth protocol stack implementation, its profiles, and its application in embedded
                                    connectivity. We developed SDKs, hardware reference designs, and software tools in addition
                                    to the software itself.</p>
                                <p>I worked collaboratively with our team to develop and document software workflows, tools,
                                    and processes that were appropriate for a startup technology company.</p>
                                <p>Bluetooth was an emerging technology in the early 2000s, and it was starting to get traction
                                    in mobile phones. Working closely with our product managers, we designed an API and SDK
                                    tailored for mobile phone integration, which helped provide an advantage against generic
                                    solutions when competing for mobile sockets.</p>
                                <p>I was a technology advocate for Bluetooth while at WIDCOMM, and I presented on topics related
                                    to Bluetooth technology at the 3G Mobile Systems Conference in Tokyo, as well as presenting
                                    for San Diego's local technical community.</p>
                                <p>WIDCOMM was acquired by Broadcom in 2004.

                                <p>Staccato Communications was a technology startup founded in 2002 to develop the world's first
                                    single-chip CMOS Ultra-wideband SoC. Its products included single-chip integrated circuits,
                                    device adapters, reference design kits, and software development kits. </p>
                                <p>As the Director of Software Engineering, I built and managed the software team responsible
                                    for embedded MAC firmware, framework, tools, drivers, embedded and Windows SDKs as well
                                    as applications of UWB Ultra-wideband Technology including Wireless USB and Bluetooth
                                    AMP. I also initiated offshore development to mitigate costs of non-core development.</p>
                                <p>At Staccato, the firmware was developed from the ground up in embedded C using a form of
                                    template method pattern and related strategies to incorporate diagnostics into the core
                                    design. The philosophy of design for test allowed the technical IP to be built on top
                                    of a lightweight diagnostics framework as opposed to "bolting on" diagnostics after the
                                    implementation was complete.</p>
                                <p>I worked with our software developers to codify software process and workflows that were
                                    appropriate for a technology startup, creating a disciplined development environment
                                    that did not stifle the team's creativity or ability to work quickly.</p>
                                <p>UWB was an emerging technology and I worked closely with our marketing, sales, and international
                                    customers providing sales material and training collateral. My team and I provided on-site
                                    technical support to promote Staccato's Ultra-wideband technology to key customers.</p>
